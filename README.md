# Grade Card Generator
This project is a software application designed to automate the creation of academic grade cards or report cards for students. It typically involves a user interface for data input and uses C++ programming to process and generate the grade cards. Here's a brief description of such a project:

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The Grade Card Generator is a C++ program that allows educators and administrators to streamline the process of creating and distributing grade cards to students.
This project typically involves the following components:
User Interface: The program may include a user-friendly interface to input data. Users can enter student information, course details, and corresponding grades.
Data Storage: Data is stored in a dat file.
Data Processing: Using C++ functions and logic, the program calculates cumulative grades, averages, and any additional metrics required for the grade card.
Grade Card Generation: The program generates individual grade cards for each student, which typically include the student's name, ID, course names, grades, and comments if necessary.
Security and Access Control: For the access of data from an authorized person, a password system has been setup for user authentication and access control to ensure the privacy and security of student data.

BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO OBJECT-ORIENTED
PROGRAMMING(OOP):
C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the six pillars of
object-oriented development:
1)Encapsulation: Making of a single object comprises many smaller entities.
2)Abstraction: The process to make partial things to be private and accessible to the world.
3)Data hiding: Some parts become private or hidden from the outside world.
4)Polymorphism: Different forms in which an object can behave differently in different situations.
- Operator overloading
- Function overloading
- 5)Class: It is a user defined data type which holds its own data members and member functions , which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
- 6)Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties from another class is called inheritance.
