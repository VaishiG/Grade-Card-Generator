BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO OBJECT-ORIENTED
PROGRAMMING(OOP):
C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the six pillars of
object-oriented development:
i)Encapsulation: Making of a single object comprises many smaller
entities.
ii)Abstraction: The process to make partial things to be private and
accessible to the world.
iii)Data hiding: Some parts become private or hidden from the
outside world.
iv)Polymorphism: Different forms in which an object can behave
differently in different situations.
- Operator overloading
- Function overloading
v) Class: It is a user defined data type which holds its own data
members and member functions , which can be accessed and used
by creating an instance of that class.
vi)Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties from
another class is called inheritance.
